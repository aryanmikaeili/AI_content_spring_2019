# AI_content_spring_2019

the practical homework, I designed for the AI course in Spring 2019.
I designed a game like tetris, in which two players should place specific blocks on a board and the player who couldn't put their block loses.
The game is implemented using java.

students had to implement an intelligent player using min-max algorithm.
